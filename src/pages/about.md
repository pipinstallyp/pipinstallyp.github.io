## About Me

Hi, I'm pipinstallyp! With a coding journey that began in 2012, I started my adventures in tech by creating websites on forumotion. From India, my curiosity has led me on an exploration of the intricate workings of both biological and artificial brains. 

Over the years my portfolio has evolved; I served as an active IEEE member from 2018 to 2021 and currently run a community known as finetuner AI labs. I spend my days as a software engineer, with this profile dedicated to all things AI. Currently, I am cooperating with Stable Diffusion, having been playing around it since August 22nd, 2022.

## Current Projects

My current universe of work includes:

- Stable Diffusion: Enhancing the entire experience of finetuning models.
- Pytorch: Learning it's core basics, and learning to optimse from the best [kohya](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss)
- Terraform: That's what I do as my day job. I write terraform scripts to create Azure infra, I've created subnets. Worked to deliver infra within 2 days instead of two weeks. 

## Constant Learning

I'm deeply passionate about improvement and continual learning. At present my focus is on the minigpt-4 batch! A significant project working towards easing captioning images for training Stable Diffusion models, ultimately for anyone keen to finetune their own Stable Diffusion models and create extemely good captions for it.

## Future Goals

Here's a snapshot of my upcoming goals:

- Launching the Transformer Keyboard project.
- Integrating Imagebind with Stable Diffusion and DeepFloyd.
- Adventuring with Alphafold and DNA diffusion.
